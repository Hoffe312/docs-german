Now that you understand how Proof of Stake works, here is an introduction to the consensus mechanism that precedes PoS, Proof of Work.

**Crypto Market Capitalization explained:** [https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/crypto-market-capitalization-explained](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/crypto-market-capitalization-explained)

You may have heard the term ‚Äú Market Cap‚Äù mentioned before in both the crypto and TradFi world. It refers to the current market value of an asset, but as you read the article it will become clear this can be a misleading metric, with the diluted market cap perhaps being more accurate. Oh, and we may have some Kujira Caps coming soon ;)

**Migration to Kujira Mainnet:**                                                                                            [https://medium.com/team-kujira/migration-to-kujira-mainnet-cc04d88da338](https://medium.com/team-kujira/migration-to-kujira-mainnet-cc04d88da338)

**What‚Äôs the Difference Between Maximum, Circulating and Total Supply?:** [https://www.coindesk.com/learn/crypto-token-supply-whats-the-difference-between-maximum-circulating-and-total-supply/](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/crypto-token-supply-whats-the-difference-between-maximum-circulating-and-total-supply/)

These 3 metrics can be extremely useful in determining the value of an asset, but which should you use? Read this article to find out what each metric describes to come to a conclusion yourself.

## Intermediate

**What is DeFi?:** [https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto/what-is-defi-decentralized-finance](https://www.ledger.com/academy/crypto/what-is-defi-decentralized-finance)

In this article, you can see examples of DeFi use-cases and their benefits. As the Kujira ecosystem grows, so too will the DeFi on the network so it is worth understanding how it works.

**What‚Äôs a blockchain bridge?:**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              [https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-s-a-blockchain-bridge](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-s-a-blockchain-bridge)

Blockchain bridges connect different blockchains within crypto, allowing communication and the transfer of assets between them. With interoperability of paramount importance in DeFi, it is essential to appreciate how bridges work and why we need them.

**What is crypto lending?:** [https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-crypto-lending](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-crypto-lending)

Crypto lending is an essential component of DeFi, with the TVL of money markets booming as a result. But what is crypto lending, why do users participate and how can you stay safe while taking part?

**DeFi liquidations explained:** [https://www.ledger.com/academy/defi-liquidation-explained](https://www.ledger.com/academy/defi-liquidation-explained)

The cr√®me de la cr√®me of Kujira. ORCA deals with the liquidations of bad loans, keeping money markets solvent. For a recap on what liquidations are, and how to avoid being liquidated yourself, this article will assist you.

**What are perpetual futures contracts?:**                                   [https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-perpetual-futures-contracts](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-perpetual-futures-contracts)

Now I won‚Äôt lie, this article is one of the trickiest to understand of this list and may take a few reads to wrap your head around it. Perpetual futures allow users to leverage trade with more capital than they own, with no contract expiry date. Although this method increases your profits, it also exacerbates any losses. It is therefore wise to read this article before participating.

**Blockchain oracles explained:**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     [https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/blockchain-oracles-explained](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/blockchain-oracles-explained)

An accurate blockchain price oracle is essential for liquidations and margin trading to run smoothly on Kujira - if there is no accurate and verifiable price data, users may be wrongfully liquidated or limit orders filled at the wrong time. However, this is just one example of the use-cases oracles provide - for more examples and an explanation of how they work, read through this article.

**Impermanent loss explained:**                                           [https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained)

Since Kujira does not use liquidity pools, users in the Kujira ecosystem will never experience impermanent loss as a result of yield farming. However, this gives us an opportunity to reinforce why the use of LPs and yield farming is a flawed model by providing an understanding of the major risk.

**Tendermint explained:** [https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/tendermint-explained](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/tendermint-explained)

The Kujira network is built on top of the Tendermint consensus mechanism that underpins all of Cosmos. Without the giant that is Tendermint, none of the Cosmos/IBC ecosystems would exist - an appreciation of how it works is greatly recommended.

**What are makers and takers explained:**                                                                              [https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-makers-and-takers](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-makers-and-takers)

**What is tokenomics and why does it matter:**                                                                                                                                                      [https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-tokenomics-and-why-does-it-matter](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-tokenomics-and-why-does-it-matter)

Poor tokenomics can turn the best builders in the space into an investor's nightmare. The term is coined from the words ‚ÄúToken Economics‚Äù and broadly describes a range of variables that impact a token‚Äôs use and value. To learn how these elements contribute to an assets value, read this article.

**What is a Layer 1 in Blockchain:**                                                                                                                                                                                                           [https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-layer-1-in-blockchain](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-layer-1-in-blockchain)

Kujira is a new Layer 1 blockchain built on the Cosmos network. Put simply, a layer 1 processes and finalizes transactions on its own blockchain and can be built upon to provide another layer of infrastructure - layer 2. This article will take you through what layer 1s are, some issues with scalability and finally some examples present currently in crypto.

## Trading

**What is a trading journal and how to use one:**                                                         [https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-a-trading-journal-and-how-to-use-one](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-a-trading-journal-and-how-to-use-one)
