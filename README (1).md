# Why Kujira

Here are some of the reasons why Kujira stands out:

* Ecosystem-wide staking: Kujira is a Proof of Stake network, which means that **all of our core dApps use a shared pool of tokens** to secure the network. Furthermore, **third party applications share a portion of their revenue with** [**KUJI**](tokenomics/kuji-token/) **stakers**. This allows users to earn rewards for participating in the network, regardless of which dApp they use.
* Cross-chain functionality: Kujira is built on the Cosmos SDK, which means that it has the ability to connect with other blockchains through the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. _This makes it simple for developers to build dApps that interact with other networks and for users to access a wide range of services and assets_.
* Robust infrastructure: Kujira has a strong infrastructure layer that provides a stable foundation for dApps to build on. Our ecosystem is built from the ground up to be composable, circular, and complete. This includes features like governance, staking, cross-chain interoperability, and a long list of synergistic base-layer infrastructure that is essential for any decentralized ecosystem.
* Strong community: Kujira has a vibrant and engaged community of developers, users, and stakeholders who are committed to the success of the network. Whether you're looking for support, feedback, or just want to connect with like-minded individuals, Kujira has a strong sense of community that makes it a great place to be.

Overall, Kujira is a powerful and flexible ecosystem that is well-suited for developers and users who want to build and use decentralized applications that are sustainable, reliable, and user-friendly. Whether you're a developer looking for a platform to build on, or a user looking for a wide range of services and assets, Kujira has a lot to offer.
