# (Retired) The Kujira Senate

The Kujira Senate was a governance structure for the Kujira blockchain aiming to support the stability and growth of the ecosystem, facilitate validating on the platform, and represent the values of the community. It was composed of up to nine experts elected by the staking community and is accountable, transparent, and democratic.

The Senate was responsible for casting votes on proposals related to requests for grants from the community fund and will review and decide on the Kujira Community Pool's budget. It aimed to enhance decentralization by amplifying the voices of elected representatives and allowing those with knowledge, experience, and the trust of the community to have an impact.&#x20;

The Senate was implemented through two smart contracts that created the necessary technical infrastructure and then public elections followed by onboarding of Senators. Find more information [here](../../dapps-and-infrastructure/senate.md).
