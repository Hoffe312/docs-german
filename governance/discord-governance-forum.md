# Discord Governance Forum

The Discord Governance Forum is an important platform for the Kujira community to discuss new project proposals and ideas for the Kujira chain. It is also a place where community members can communicate their views and engage with others about governance proposals.

The forum provides a democratic space for members of the Kujira community to discuss and collaborate on proposals before they are formally submitted for governance. This helps ensure that proposals are well-thought-out and have the support of the community before they are put to a vote.

To participate in the Discord Governance Forum, you will need to join the Kujira Discord server and join the appropriate channels. It's a great way to get involved in the decision-making process and help shape the future of the Kujira chain.
