# Lending and Borrowing KUJI

[GHOST](../../dapps-and-infrastructure/ghost-money-market/), Kujira's native 1st party money market, leverages [ORCA](../../dapps-and-infrastructure/orca/) to allow community members to safely borrow against KUJI collateral or borrow KUJI against other provided collateral. This new functionality allows traders and holders alike to long and short KUJI. &#x20;
