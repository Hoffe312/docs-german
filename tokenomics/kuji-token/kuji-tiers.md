# Staking Tiers and Symbols on BLUE, FIN, and ORCA

If you are a user of Kujira's BLUE, FIN, or ORCA apps, you may have noticed some symbols located at the top right corner of each app. <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (10) (1).png" alt="" data-size="line">&#x20;

These symbols are tied to the amount of KUJI that a user has staked across all Kujira validators on the mainnet. Specifically, the symbols will light up as follows:

* The leftmost symbol will light up when a user has staked 500 KUJI or more.
* The middle symbol will light up when a user has staked 5000 KUJI or more.
* The rightmost symbol will light up when a user has staked 50000 KUJI or more.

Do these symbols represent something significant? That's currently a mystery. It is worth noting that these are not the only symbols that may appear in the future. Stay tuned for new updates.
