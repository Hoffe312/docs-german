# Staking KUJI

Staking KUJI on the Kujira Network with a Kujira validator allows users to earn [xKUJI](../../dapps-and-infrastructure/ghost-money-market/lend.md#how-does-lending-work-on-ghost) and [xUSK](../../dapps-and-infrastructure/usk-stablecoin.md) over time. All fees collected on the network are paid directly to stakers through the validators, after being converted to KUJI first. This makes it easy for users to accumulate a diversified staking yield rather than just more KUJI. Kujira is also adding the option to redeem staking rewards as KUJI based on popular demand.

Some key points about staking KUJI on the Kujira Network include:

* Earn yield bearing xKUJI and [xUSK](../../dapps-and-infrastructure/ghost-money-market/lend.md#how-does-lending-work-on-ghost) by staking KUJI with a Kujira validator
* Fees collected on the network (including airdrops) are paid directly to stakers through the validators
* All revenue grows Kujira's TVL
* 50% of staking yield is in a yield bearing USD denominated stablecoin
* Option to redeem staking rewards automatically as scheduled (using Fuzion's [DustButler](https://fuzion.app/dustbuster))
* Kujira is [sustainable](../../introduction/why-kujira/values/sustainability.md) and does not rely on inflationary tokens to incentivize staking
* Revenue from Kujira's core dApps, such as [ORCA](../../dapps-and-infrastructure/orca/) and [FIN](../../dapps-and-infrastructure/fin/), as well as a portion of revenue from each external protocol that launches on the chain, is sent back to stakers
