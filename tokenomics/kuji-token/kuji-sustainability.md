# KUJI Sustainability

Since KUJI is not an inflationary asset and relies on adoption of its decentralized applications and products to generate fees, KUJI is sustainable. It does not rely on a Ponzi like structure to reward stakers in KUJI printed out of thin air.

[Stakers are rewarded with KUJI as well as USK and USDC](https://x.com/TeamKujira/status/1767231977340477755?s=20) that are converted from tokens paid as fees on Kujira dApps such as FIN. This creates constant buy pressure for KUJI while allowing it to be sustainable.

Without needing to pivot its mechanism, we as developers can simply concentrate on building out the best products possible, fostering a strong community, and bringing high integrity to everything we do.&#x20;

More can be found about why KUJI is sustainable and what that means to us as part of our ethos [here](../../introduction/why-kujira/values/sustainability.md).&#x20;
