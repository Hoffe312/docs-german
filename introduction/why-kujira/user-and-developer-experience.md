# User and Developer Experience

### Semi-Permissioned

In order for a contract to launch on Kujira, it needs to be voted in via governance. By deciding as a community, we protect the quality, sustainability, and longevity of the network. The result is that Kujira becomes a tight-knit hub of revenue-generating products with great UX.

### On-chain Scheduler

The on-chain scheduler allows protocols to be designed with much less of a reliance on bots. This means there are far fewer wasted transactions. Protocols can be designed to operate more efficiently, and fees which were once required to incentivize bot usage can go back to the users of the network.

### Native Token Generation

Smart contract developers no longer need to handle two individual entry points into their contracts, only needing to design for a native denomination. In doing so, every token on the network will be a native Cosmos token, and associated liquidation and trading revenue (with more to come) will all accrue to KUJI stakers.

### Build with Cosmos SDK

Access the entire Cosmos ecosystem seamlessly in an environment with proven security and interoperability via IBC.

### CosmWASM 1.1 Support

Leverage Rust’s expressive type system and Cosmwasm’s best in class architecture to fearlessly build safe and secure smart contracts.

### Thriving Community

With 50K+ active users and a very engaged Twitter, Discord and Telegram community, this is a welcoming home to hit the ground running in.

### Built to Last

A long term view for real-world use, revenue, and sustainability for builders, validators and users alike.

### Better Tokenomics

All projects launching on Kujira can propose to list their token on FIN, our CLOB DEX. Thus, tokens are not needed for liquidity pools although protocols can source liquidity however they want. Furthermore, as KUJI stakers receive a proportional share of every cent of Kuijra protocol revenue, Kujira projects with tokens on FIN are constantly ‘airdropped’ to all KUJI stakers. This advertising lessens any need for inflationary incentives.

### Sophisticated On-Chain Price Oracle

Kujira's [price oracle](../../validators/run-a-node/oracle-price-feeder.md) is submitted by all 75 active validators as a part of Kujira's [consensus](../../governance/staking/#consensus) mechanism. The prices are measured by at least 3 independent sources as well guaranteeing reliability, stability, and high quality performance over time. Our oracle can also be directly queried by protocols in their smart contracts giving them a solid edge against developers based on other blockchains.&#x20;

### Cryptographically Verifiable On-Chain Randomness via Entropy Beacon

Entropic Labs' [Entropy Beacon](../../developers/smart-contracts/entropy-beacon.md) is a decentralized source of randomness for blockchain developers. Beacon provides secure random number generation in trustless on-chain environments, the first to do so on Cosmos-based blockchains. Furthermore, as part of our feegrant program, protocols consuming randomness do not need to take on any extra fees or pass them to users.
