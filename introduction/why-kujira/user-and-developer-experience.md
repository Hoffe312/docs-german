# User and Developer Experience

### Semi-Permissioned

In order for a contract to launch on Kujira, it needs to be voted in via governance. By deciding as a community, we protect the quality, sustainability, and longevity of the network. The result is that Kujira becomes a tight-knit hub of revenue-generating products with great UX.

### On-Chain Scheduler

The on-chain scheduler allows protocols to be designed with far less reliance on bots. This means there are far fewer wasted transactions. Protocols can be designed to operate more efficiently, and fees which were once required to incentivize bot usage can go back to the users of the network.

### Native Token Generation

Smart contract developers no longer need to handle two individual entry points into their contracts, only needing to design for a native denomination.

In doing so, every token on the network will be a 'native' Cosmos token, and associated Kujira product revenue from trading, liquidations, borrowing, etc. will all accrue to KUJI stakers.

### Build with Cosmos SDK

Access the entire Cosmos ecosystem seamlessly in an environment with proven security and interoperability via IBC.

### CosmWasm Support & Confio Integration

Leverage Rust’s expressive type system and CosmWasm’s best in class architecture to fearlessly build safe and secure smart contracts.

Moreover, as one of the first few chains to sign up for Confio's subscription model, our developers have unparalleled access to CosmWasm's tooling and utility & dedicated support from CosmWasm experts.&#x20;

### Thriving Community

With 100K+ active users and a very engaged Twitter, Discord, and Telegram community, this is a welcoming home for Web 3 novices and professionals alike.

### Built to Last

A long term view for real-world use, revenue, and sustainability, for builders, validators, and users.

### Better Tokenomics

All projects launching on Kujira can propose to list their token on [FIN](../../dapps-and-infrastructure/fin/), our CLOB DEX. Our liquidity engine, [BOW](../../dapps-and-infrastructure/bow/), plays off the special nature of FIN to drastically reduce liquidity needed to incentivize trading. Projects are therefore able to save on tokens that would otherwise be needed for liquidity pools, which gives them stronger tokenomics appeal than their competitors.

Projects can also take advantage of Kujira's unique on-chain tooling that allows them to make the most of their funds and tokens in various ways while preserving liquidity and capital. &#x20;

### Sophisticated On-Chain Price Oracle

Kujira's [price oracle](../../validators/run-a-node/oracle-price-feeder.md) is submitted by all 75 active validators as a part of Kujira's [consensus](../../governance/staking/#consensus) mechanism. The prices are measured by at least 3 independent sources, guaranteeing reliability, stability, and high quality performance over time. Our oracle can also be directly queried by protocols in their smart contracts giving them a solid edge against developers based on other blockchains.&#x20;

### Cryptographically Verifiable On-Chain Randomness via Entropy Beacon

Entropic Labs' [Entropy Beacon](../../developers/smart-contracts/entropy-beacon.md) is a decentralized source of randomness for blockchain developers. Beacon provides secure random number generation in trustless on-chain environments, the first to do so on Cosmos-based blockchains. Furthermore, as part of our feegrant program, protocols consuming randomness do not need to take on any extra fees or pass them to users.
