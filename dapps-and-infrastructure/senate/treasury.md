# Treasury

## [https://blue.kujira.app/senate](https://blue.kujira.app/senate)

## Overview

The Treasury is a collection of tokens that the [Kujira Senate](../senate.md) uses to fund projects, partnerships, and other initiatives that benefit the community. It is replenished through the community fund, which accumulates 2% of network fees from gas and transactions on the Kuijra network's first-party dApps, as well as from revenue share on third-party Kujira dApps. These funds are transferred to the treasury through governance, ensuring that it has a sustainable source of funding over time.

As the Kuijra network's fees are paid using the assets being traded or bid on, the treasury is able to accumulate a diverse range of tokens. This gives it the flexibility to adapt to changes in market demand and remain resilient in the long term.

A detailed breakdown of the treasury can most easily be seen on the BLUE senate tab [here](treasury.md#https-blue.kujira.app-senate).&#x20;
