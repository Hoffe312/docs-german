# Past Senate Proposals

The Senate uses a multisig to vote on proposals in accordance with the majority will of all involved Senators. With the current governance setup, as soon as 6 senators vote yes on a proposal it will immediately be passed and other senators will not be able to vote on it after that point. Anyone can then execute a passed proposal. A list of past proposals considered by the Senate can be found [here](https://blue.kujira.app/senate) directly on BLUE.
