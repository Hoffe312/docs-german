# Contacting the Senate

There are a number of ways to contact the Kujira Senate.&#x20;

The Kujira Senate can be reached via email at 'kujirasenate@proton.me'.

The Kujira Senate has its own Twitter account [@KujiraSenate](https://twitter.com/KujiraSenate).

Senators can always be @'ed in the main Kujira Telegram chat (all Senators other than Daniel Lux have the Senators tag).&#x20;

The [Discord Senator governance forum](https://discordapp.com/channels/970650215801569330/1021059072050597920) is used to kick off discussions related to community pool management and general funding proposals.

The 'senate' channel allows community members to write down their thoughts and interact with Senators directly in a public space.

Finally, although Senators are quite busy, it is possible to send direct messages to Senators on Telegram, Twitter, or Discord. Senators have their own preferred communication platforms so it may be necessary to try multiple methods.&#x20;
