# How to View the Analytics on a Liquidation Market

* Navigate to [orca.kujira.app](https://orca.kujira.app/)
* Connect on the top right to your Keplr or Sonar wallet by clicking the connect wallet button and selecting the corresponding wallet (Keplr or Sonar)
* Select the appropriate collateral market–in this case wETH and click the blue ‘View Market’ button on the far right
* Next, on the top left, click on the ‘Analytics’ tab–at the top is a display of some basic information about this ORCA market. There are also two diagrams displaying some basic liquidation analytics. And finally a summary of recent liquidations appears at the very bottom
