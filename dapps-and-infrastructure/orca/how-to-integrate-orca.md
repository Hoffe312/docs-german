# How to Integrate ORCA

A new era of ORCA is here. Developers can empower their communities and allow them to participate in and profit from liquidations more easily than ever before.

We understand that it can be a complex process to make strategic business decisions and integrate third party protocols. That is why we want to make it as easy as possible for coders, business developers, and other related parties to understand the ORCA integration process.&#x20;

Below, we have included two detailed guides on how to Integrate ORCA, one for Rust based liquidation markets and one for EVM based liquidation markets.
