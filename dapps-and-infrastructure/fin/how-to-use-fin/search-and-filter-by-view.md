# Search and Filter by View

## Overview

Two important aspects of the FIN trading experience is the search tool and the selected view which can be found on the top left corner of the FIN UI. As FIN grows and hundreds of token pairs are onboarded over time, it would be difficult for users to find specific pairs, see new activity, or conveniently browse through their favorites. As such, we have given users two handy tools to make the FIN experience better for users and partner protocols alike.

## Search

On the top left of the FIN UI, a search bar allows users to enter tokens names. By entering a token name (or partial string) in the search bar, FIN will automatically filter out all unrelated pairs and only display token pairs containing that token. For example, entering 'nj' will bring up INJ/USK. Entering 'US' will bring up every [USK](../../usk-stablecoin.md) token pair as well as every axlUSDC token pair listed on FIN. This is an effective way to randomly stumble into new token pairs or narrow down the search for a specific token pair. Typing in the search bar also automatically changes the view to 'All'.

## Filter by view&#x20;

In addition to the search bar, FIN allows an option to filter token pairs by view which is useful to look for featured, or other new or unexpected token pairs. There are 5 different views on FIN:

* Featured
* USK
* USDC
* Manta
* Ghost
* All
* :star:

### Featured

The Featured view is the default view when opening FIN and brings the greatest amount of attention to included token pairs. This view displays only featured FIN token pairs and filters all other pairs out from the FIN user interface. Featured pairs are noteworthy token pairs (main [KUJI](../../../tokenomics/kuji-token/) pairs, USK collateral token pairs, popular assets, etc.) that the team or community expect to drive high volume.

### USK

The [USK ](../../usk-stablecoin.md)view only displays FIN token pairs that contain USK.

### USDC

The USDC view only displays FIN token pairs that contain USDC.

### Manta

The Manta view only displays FIN token pairs that contain MNTA.

### Ghost

The Ghost view only displays FIN token pairs that contain xTOKENS.

Clicking on the mini ghost next to these pairs will send you directly to [GHOST](../../ghost-money-market/) where you can manually lend or withdraw your tokens for these pairs.&#x20;

Ghost pairs track the accumulated lending interest on xTOKENS from GHOST lending over time.

### All

This view is an exhaustive list of all FIN token pairs and can be used to discover all available token pairs on FIN.&#x20;

### :star:

The favorites view contains all favorited token pairs by a specific user for quick and easy access. To add or remove pairs from this view, simply navigate to any token pair on FIN from some other view and click on the black star with a gray border to the left of the pair on the UI. Favorited pairs will be filled in with gray. &#x20;

Furthermore, for every trading pair, simply click on the silver [BOW](../../bow/) or gold CALC circles to directly navigate to the corresponding BOW liquidity pool or CALC UI that allows users to dollar cost average (DCA) into or out of the trading pair. &#x20;
