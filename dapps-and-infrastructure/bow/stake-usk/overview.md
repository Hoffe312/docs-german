# Overview

[https://bow.kujira.network/usk](https://bow.kujira.network/usk)

## Incentives

The left half of the multi-stake Overview page shows current pool incentives that are distributed to all USK multi-stake users. These LPs are distributed equally across every LP/ Basically, for bigger pools, the same amount of LP nets a smaller share of the overall daily fees distributed to that pool from the overall incentives. Therefore, it makes the most sense to stake your USK LPs in smaller pools (which have higher APRs), and the ultimate result is equalizing overall USK liquidity size across BOW pairs.&#x20;

By clicking on the 'add incentives to this pool' hyperlink, it will bring up an interface that allows you to deposit various tokens and select custom settings. You can select either decreasing or fixed incentive types. You can read more about how this works [here](https://docs.kujira.app/dapps-and-infrastructure/bow/pools/all-liquidity-pools/pool-overview#incentive-release-schedule).&#x20;

## Incentivized Tokens

The right half of the overview page shows the pairs that are being incentivized. They are listed in alphabetical order from top to bottom, however all pairs that you have staked LP tokens for will appear at the top showing you the amount of LP you have staked, the total amount of that LP staked on the multi-stake tab across all BOW users, the $ value of daily incentives going to the entire pool, and the annualized APR based on the current $ value.

Much like the BOW dashboard tab, this allows you to track your various Multi-stake LP positions, calculate your projected daily earnings on them, and make decisions about possible LPs that you might like to add liquidity to.
