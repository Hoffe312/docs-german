# Stake USK

[https://bow.kujira.network/usk](https://bow.kujira.network/usk)

## Overview

The USK Multi-stake BOW tab contains a single incentive pot, shared between **USK paired LP tokens**.&#x20;

Earn a share of a single set of incentives by staking USK-paired LP tokens.

This is a wholly separate set of incentives from the extra incentives on individual BOW pairs. Furthermore, this strategy not only helps give USK more utility and inherent demand, but also helps smaller USK pairs attract liquidity and balance overall pair liquidity.

This section of BOW has three separate subtabs: '[Overview](overview.md)', '[Stake/Unstake](stake-unstake.md)', and '[Rewards](rewards.md)'.
