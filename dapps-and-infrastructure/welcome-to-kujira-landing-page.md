# Welcome to Kujira (Landing Page)

**Spot Trading**: Kujira [FIN](fin/) is a 100% on-chain, fair matching, decentralized, permissionless, orderbook  style token exchange. [Here's how to buy KUJI on FIN](https://winkhub.app/posts/how-to-buy-kuji-on-fin).

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (69).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Token Swap**: You can use the [swap tab](blue/swap.md) on [BLUE](blue/) to exchange assets for[ KUJI](../tokenomics/kuji-token/) and swap between other assets for a small fee.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (70).png" alt="" width="360"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Futures**: Kujira Futures is a [perpetual trading platform](https://winkhub.app/posts/perpetual-trading-coming-to-kujira-the-bullish-case-for-kuji-stakers) letting you open leveraged long and short positions with both spot and margin positions. Built on top of [FIN](fin/), it will allow you to trade perpetual contracts for almost anything, maybe even property prices.&#x20;

**Stake**: [Stake](blue/stake.md) your [KUJI](../tokenomics/kuji-token/) with (a) [validator](broken-reference)(s) to earn your share of Kujira network revenue. 98% of all revenue generated by Kujira will soon be distributed to KUJI stakers as [xKUJI](ghost-money-market/lend.md#how-does-lending-work-on-ghost) and x[USK](usk-stablecoin.md).

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption><p>Validators are ordered from smallest to largest to promote decentralization</p></figcaption></figure>

**Liquidity Pools**: By adding liquidity to specific pools on [BOW](bow/), you can earn a slice of all profits made on [FIN](fin/) from trading that pair + any extra third party [incentives](bow/product-guides/how-to-provide-incentives.md) for the pool.
