# Fund your wallet

To get started on the Kujira network, and begin using the SONAR wallet, it is first necessary to fund your wallet with assets.&#x20;

There are a few different ways to do this:

* Kado allows users to directly convert their local currency to stablecoins and onramp them straight to SONAR on the Kujira network. Kado is available in 150+ countries (read more about restricted countries [here](https://faq.kado.money/en/article/where-is-kado-operational-1oe3bht/)).
* Directly deposit Ethereum, wrapped Ethereum, or USDC from the Ethereum network straight to SONAR on the Kujira network (using the power of Squid router).
* Directly deposit assets to SONAR on the Kujira network from each supported chain. Due to Kujira's [token factory](../../../developers/smart-contracts/token-factory.md), every asset is a native asset on the Kujira network.&#x20;

As gas can natively be paid in any token on the Kujira network, it's even more straightforward to onboard to the network. The next step is to[ customize your wallet settings](customize-your-settings.md).&#x20;
