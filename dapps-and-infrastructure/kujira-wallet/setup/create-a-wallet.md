# Create a wallet

## Overview

The first step to using Sonar is to create a wallet. This can be done in a few ways:

* Create a brand new wallet
* Connect a hardware wallet such a ledger device for extra security
* Restore an existing address from elsewhere by entering a seed phrase

We provide a few step-by-step visual guides below for how to set up a Sonar wallet.

## Create New Wallet

'The create new wallet' option simply means that you will be creating a new Sonar wallet from scratch. It'll be associated with a brand new Kujira address. And as part of the setup, you'll be provided with essential access credentials (a seed phrase or iCloud storage via passkey).&#x20;

This option is most convenient for anyone who wants a fresh start on Kujira and who doesn't mind sending assets between wallet addresses to continue onboarding after the wallet setup is finished.&#x20;

The first step is to go to the Sonar home menu and click on the little plus that appears on the top right.

You'll see a submenu up with 3 choices. You'll want to pick the first one: 'Create New Wallet'.

Next, you'll be prompted to enter a wallet name. This name won't be public. It can be used to fashion your own personal digital identity or distinguish between your wallets if you have multiple.

After selecting a name, the next step is to get your recovery phrase. (We'll soon have an alternative option to save your key via passkeys directly onto the Cloud for you, which'll save you the hassle of dealing with the recovery phrase yourself.)

Your seed phrase is very important. Please make sure to read the provided information. It's probably for the best to simply write it down on paper and store it carefully so that you don't lose it. You will not be able to see your seed phrase again after pressing next so make sure to record it properly. When ready touch the little eye to see the seed phrase.

Make sure to store your recovery phrase carefully. It'll be 24 words long. It's easy to label them by number: word #1, word #2, etc. They'll all be lower case without any capitalization. Only after you're sure you've stored the seed phrase successfully proceed to press next.&#x20;

You are finally almost done with your initial Sonar wallet creation. The final step of this initial process is a safety measure designed to ensure that you don't proceed with wallet creation unless you've made sure to safely record your recovery phrase somewhere.

&#x20;To prove that you have recorded it, you'll be asked to select random words from your phrase from a list of options, 3 times. You need to get all 3 right to be able to proceed.&#x20;

And now voila, you have a working Sonar wallet with your very own Kujira address. The next step is to [add funds to your wallet](fund-your-wallet.md).

## Connect Hardware Wallet

The first step is to go to the Sonar home menu and click on the little plus that appears on the top right.

You'll see a submenu up with 3 choices. Pick the second one: 'Connect Hardware Wallet'.

## Restore Wallet

If you have an existing wallet address on Kujira, you can manage your assets directly from Sonar  and gain access to its array of powerful tooling by 'restoring your wallet' via its seed phrase or private key.&#x20;

This option lets you migrate from wallets like Keplr/Leap or recover your Sonar wallet on a new phone after losing your old one. A recovery phrase is better than a private key if you have it.

We strongly recommend for the premier Kujira experience that if you have an existing Keplr wallet it is best to restore your wallet via your Keplr seed phrase into a new Sonar wallet.&#x20;

The first step is to go to the Sonar home menu and click on the little plus that appears on the top right.

## Next steps

After creating a wallet, the next step is to [fund your wallet](fund-your-wallet.md) with assets so you can start taking advantage of the Kujira network.
