# Create a wallet

## Overview

The first step to using SONAR is to create a wallet. This can be done in one of three ways:

* Creating a brand new wallet
* Connecting a hardware wallet such a ledger device for an extra secure wallet
* And restoring an existing wallet from elsewhere using that wallet's seedphrase.&#x20;

After creating a wallet, the next step is to [fund your wallet](fund-your-wallet.md) with assets so you can start taking advantage of the Kujira network.
