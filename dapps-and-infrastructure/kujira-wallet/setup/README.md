# Setup

The first step to using Sonar is to successfully download the right application.

Sonar can be found on mobile on [sonar.kujira.network](https://sonar.kujira.network/) which has links to both the iOS and Android BETAs. The privacy policy can be reviewed [here](https://sonar.kujira.network/privacy-policy). And Sonar news can be tracked [here](https://twitter.com/SonarWallet).&#x20;

To onboard onto Sonar, simple create a wallet, fund it with assets, and then perform some basic customization for wallet security and personalization.

Here's the three step process:

* [Create a wallet](create-a-wallet.md)
* [Fund your wallet](fund-your-wallet.md)
* [Customize settings](customize-your-settings.md)
