# Setup

The first step to using SONAR is to successfully download the right application.

SONAR can be found on mobile on [sonar.kujira.app](https://sonar.kujira.network/) / [sonar.kujira.network](https://sonar.kujira.network/) which has links to both the iOS and Android BETAs. The privacy policy can be reviewed [here](https://sonar.kujira.network/privacy-policy). And Sonar news can be tracked [here](https://twitter.com/SonarWallet).&#x20;

The easiest way to get onboarded with SONAR is to create a wallet, fund it with assets, and then perform some basic customization for wallet security and personalization.
