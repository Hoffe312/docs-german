# Using Sonar

SONAR allows Kujira to provide a highly customized native experience for the Kujira blockchain.

In general, the SONAR wallet experienced can be subdivided into mobile and desktop use.

SONAR is a wallet tool that can be used to split payments between friends; send/receive money to/from others; and put your assets to work: move, swap, borrow, lend, or liquidate assets freely; and a variety of other specialized use cases.

[The mobile experience](mobile/) encompasses using SONAR to split payments between friends; send/receive money to/from others; and put your assets to work: move, swap, borrow, lend, or liquidate assets freely.

[The desktop experience](desktop.md) for SONAR involves everything mentioned above (except splitting payments with friends) and a variety of other specialized use cases. To use SONAR on desktop, there is a special section on the SONAR mobile app "sites", where a QR scanner can be pulled up. The QR scanner is used by pointing the phone camera at desktop web pages to connect to established decentralized applications and websites.
