# Home

Home is your home base while using SONAR.

View your wallet balances for each asset and review all of your past transactions at any time.&#x20;

## Balances

Within the balances tab, all token balances in your Sonar wallet display (including staked KUJI).

By tapping on tokens, a pop up menu appears with a few different options, that vary slightly depending on the token.&#x20;

When tapping on KUJI, the options that appear are 'Send', 'Trade', 'Swap', and Bid. Furthermore, other basic information displays such as current token price; 24 hour % change in price; 24 hour high; 24 hour low; current lend APR; Eris Protocol rate; and Quark Protocol rate.&#x20;

For ampKUJI, most fields are the same; however, there are no fields such as current lend APR or Eris/Quark protocol rates. Instead there's an Unstake.Fi unstake rate + other data.&#x20;

Meanwhile tapping on axlUSDC produces much the same layout as KUJI however there are no displays for Eris protocol or Quark protocol and there is an extra 'Spend' option between 'Trade' and 'Swap. &#x20;

These tabs help the user easily navigate to other relevant tabs.
