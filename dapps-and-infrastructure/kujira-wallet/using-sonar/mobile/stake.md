# Stake

Staking is the process of bonding KUJI to a validator in exchange for staking rewards generated from real revenue. Validators can use that bonded KUJI to help secure the chain. Meanwhile, every KUJI staked captures a proportional slice of the revenue generated by the Kujira Network from its many applications. KUJI can be staked to any validator within the Stake tab. Read more about staking [here](../../../blue/stake.md).
