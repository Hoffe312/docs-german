## INTRODUCTION

[Sonar](https://mobile.twitter.com/SonarWallet) **is your DeFi gateway**. _Designed for Kujira, Sonar is a mobile wallet app that abstracts away complexity to provide a seamless & intuitive experience for using & making blockchain technology_.

Sonar isn't just another wallet to send or receive tokens. **At your fingertips are the many decentralized applications integrated with Kujira**. Moreover, it **establishes a framework for a real payments platform** for on-the-ground vendors, e-commerce merchants, and everyday users.

Integrated into key protocols**,** **Sonar makes Kujira more accessible than ever & provides a transparent experience that lets you move assets between chains** without caring about the underlying network.
