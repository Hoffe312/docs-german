## Creating Vesting Contracts

The BLUE wallet tab allows anyone to create vesting contracts for any asset on the Kujira blockchain. Simply send tokens to an empty (i.e. new factory default state) wallet, choose the vesting tokens option, and specify a total amount of tokens and future end date to control the vesting pace. Read more [here](https://docs.kujira.app/dapps-and-infrastructure/blue/product-guides/how-to-send-tokens).&#x20;

## Auto-convert Assets to ~~KUJI~~ Anything

~~The BLUE wallet tab has a handy tool for quickly converting small non-KUJI balances into KUJI. Read more~~ [~~here~~](https://docs.kujira.app/dapps-and-infrastructure/blue/product-guides/how-to-convert-balances-to-kuji)~~.~~ The Fuzion team have built [DustBuster](https://fuzion.app/dustbuster) so that anyone can convert multiple assets at a time to any other asset of their choice (as long as it is listed on FIN) replacing the BLUE asset auto-convert tool. Check it out [here](https://fuzion.app/dustbuster).&#x20;
