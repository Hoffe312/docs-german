# Developer

## Overview

The Developer Tab on BLUE is an accessible user interface that allows developers with qualified access on mainnet (to specific code IDs from governance) and anyone on testnet to store, instantiate, migrate, query, and execute contracts on mainnet.

## Store

The Store tab allows anyone to upload local files and store WASM byte code on-chain.

## Instantiate

The Instantiate tab can be used to create (or instantiate) contracts using stored WASM byte code, by providing the associated Code ID, Admin information, an appropriate Label, and on-chain code.

## Migrate

The Migrate tab used to migrate a contract to a new code ID. To do this, provide a current code ID, a desired migrate Code ID, then select the desired contract and finally execute migration.

## Query & Execute

The Query and execute tab is a raw interface to contracts. It specifically helps with debugging and getting data that is not immediately accessible in the UI.
