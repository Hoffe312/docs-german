# How to use IBC

* Navigate to [blue.kujira.app/ibc](https://blue.kujira.app/ibc)
* Regardless of the chain you are sending tokens from, on the top left, where it says Kuijra, choose Axelar instead.
* Next, if you would like to send AXL from Axelar continue to the next step. Otherwise, on the top left, where it says Kujira, scroll through the list and select the network you’d like to use IBC to bridge tokens to Kujira from
* Next, scroll to the box on the top right where it displays a token symbol and name. Select the token you would like to transfer to Kujira.
* Next, fill in the box on the bottom right which says ‘Send Amount’, entering the amount of tokens that you would like to IBC to Kujira
* Make sure that the address listed on the bottom right matches your intended Kujira wallet destination address
