# How to Check the Status of Governance Proposals and/or Vote

* Connect on the top right to your Keplr or Sonar wallet by clicking the connect wallet button and selecting the corresponding wallet (Keplr or Sonar)

* Scroll down to the proposal of interest that you would like to vote on. If the proposal isn’t one of the 8 most recent proposals, you can view older proposals by clicking on the pages numbered at the bottom. 2 is the second newest page of proposals… and so on up until the final page of proposals.

* Once you have located the proposal, select the ‘View Proposal’ button
* If the proposal voting process has already started or ended the following information will be displayed: Voted (what proportion of KUJI stakers or corresponding validators have voted on this proposal), Yes (the percentage of staked KUJI corresponding to voters that voted Yes on the proposal), No, Abstain, and Veto

* You may scroll down to look at the associated proposal code–and scroll down even further to look at the votes cast by validators that actually voted (and possible reasons for their decisions)
* If the proposal is still being voted on, you can vote by clicking on the desired option (Yes, No, Veto or Abstain) and sign the tx paying the fees.
