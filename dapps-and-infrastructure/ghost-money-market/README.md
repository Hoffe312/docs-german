## INTRODUCTION

Welcome to Kujira's Money Market.

Mobilize your assets by lending them out to earn interest and secure working liquidity by using them as collateral.

Whether it's short term or long, lending or borrowing, this is where value does more.

GHOST puts your capital to work.&#x20;

## FEATURES

* Leverage: Lend or borrow any asset on GHOST. Long or short
* Community ownership: Community governance can add new assets at any time
* Top tier liquidation engine: ORCA was the liquidation engine for a DeFi protocol with $20 billion in TVL. ORCA allows the entire Kujira community to benefit from liquidations, not just whales.

* Intuitive UX: GHOST streamlines the user experience for lending and borrowing assets
* DeFi Lego: GHOST will be the liquidity building block for FIN perpetuals and margin trading
* Liquidity: GHOST will supercharge the FIN orderbook, ORCA volume, and BOW liquidity
