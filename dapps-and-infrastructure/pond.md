# Pond (Developer Toolkit)

Pond creates an entire local Kujira network, complete with price feeders, and scaffolds out a dApp template that you can start building on straight away.

It takes just 3 commands to get the network running & the Pond-UI will configure itself automatically & connect to your local Pond network.

Simply follow the steps [here](https://github.com/Team-Kujira/pond-ui).

Pond will come with pre-installed contracts for all key Kujira apps including USK, FIN, GHOST, BOW, ORCA, and PILOT. Furthermore, protocol teams can PR to have theirs applications included as well.

The Pond-UI will have a sample wallet connection for Sonar, and have a demo for how to construct, sign, & broadcast a TX.
