## Overview

PILOT is a launchpad built in partnership by Kujira and [Fuzion](https://twitter.com/Fuzion\_App). It uses a unique sale method based on ORCAâ€™s revolutionary bid process to make participation equal and create fair opportunity for everyone by removing chance and speed from the process.

PILOT works together with other Fuzion products to provide a powerful growth engine for protocols at any point in their life cycle.
