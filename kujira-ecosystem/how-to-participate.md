# How to Participate

### Overview

Kujira offers a variety of ways for individuals to get involved in the ecosystem. Developers can create new products on the Kujira blockchain by referencing [POND](../dapps-and-infrastructure/pond.md), while validators can help secure and decentralize the chain on [BLUE](../dapps-and-infrastructure/blue/). Community members can also have a say in the direction of the chain by voting on changes and participating in the various features and infrastructure offered on BLUE.

The [SONAR](../dapps-and-infrastructure/kujira-wallet/) wallet offers the best possible experience for anyone on Kujira. SONAR is your DeFi gateway with a bevy of applications all at your fingertips on mobile or desktop. Download it [here](https://sonar.kujira.network/).

The Kujira blockchain can easily integrate [ORCA](../dapps-and-infrastructure/orca/) with EVM and Cosmos money markets, providing numerous benefits such as increased capital efficiency and reduced risk of insolvency. Liquidators can also bid on integrated money market liquidations with [USK](../dapps-and-infrastructure/usk-stablecoin.md) (Kujira's native stablecoin that sees use all over the Kujira ecosystem)or various yield bearing assets to purchase discounted collateral at up to a 44% discount while passively earning as liquidation bids wait to fill.

Lenders can provide assets on [GHOST](../dapps-and-infrastructure/ghost-money-market/) to receive liquid yield bearing assets in their wallet and see their deposited assets appreciate in value over time via borrow interest from borrowers of those assets on GHOST. Stablecoins like USDC & USK are seeing 20%+ average APR . Borrowers can deposit collateral to take out loans to long or short various assets that can be borrowed against the deposited collateral.&#x20;

On BLUE, [KUJI](../tokenomics/kuji-token/) stakers can collect interest bearing apex assets [xKUJI and xUSK](../dapps-and-infrastructure/ghost-money-market/lend.md) from fee revenue collected via use of Kujira dApps as a portion of total protocol revenue based on their staked KUJI.&#x20;

Users interested in staking on other Cosmos chains in an effective way that promotes greater decentralization can use [POD](../dapps-and-infrastructure/pod/) to stake on any other Cosmos chain via the POD application on Kujira.

Eager would-be investors can use [PILOT](../dapps-and-infrastructure/pilot-launchpad.md) to get in on the ground floor of new project launches and fundraises. This gives you access to opportunities previous limited to the wealthy and elite who were the only individuals with any hope of seeing early rounds to invest in an asset.&#x20;

New projects can apply to be listed on [FIN](../dapps-and-infrastructure/fin/). Projects can also advertise to the entire Kujira community by providing incentives on [BOW](../dapps-and-infrastructure/bow/). Users can also provide liquidity and stake it on BOW to farm incentives and earn rewards. Developers who want to build on Kujira can apply to participate in [Kujira Labs](broken-reference)$$-$$our virtual & in-person accelerator program in Lisbon, Portugal.

FIN also allows for margin that can be used for leveraged long positions. And minting USK is a way to go long on many different types of deposited collateral such as ATOM, wBTC, wETH, wBNB, LUNA, DOT, and gPAXG, or to invest in different projects within the Kujira ecosystem, etc.

Users and developers can track real-time wallet activity, wallet balances, past transaction history, token characteristics, smart contract addresses, etc. all on our blockchain explorer, [FINDER](../dapps-and-infrastructure/finder/).

Funding your wallet has never been easier if you want to make the most of participating in the Kujira ecosystem. There's [a bunch of methods](how-to-deposit-assets-into-the-ecosystem.md) at your disposal. Check out [this article](https://winkhub.app/posts/depositing-funds-to-kujira) for a more in-depth tutorial. Easily offramp by using Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol, bridging assets to other chains, or just buying real goods and service after first purchasing prepaid gift cards with your crypto.

Finally, our ecosystem has other products & dApps offering exciting use cases such as [an education hub for learning about Kujira](https://winkhub.app/);  [a revolutionary NFT marketplace](https://winkhub.app/posts/gojira-kujiras-revolutionary-nft-marketplace); [custom addresses](https://winkhub.app/posts/kujira-name-system-is-launching-on-the-gojira-nft-marketplace); [AI-boosted dollar cost averaging](https://calculated.fi/); [a product suite for launching, growing, and/or developing new or existing protocols](https://dashboard.fuzion.app/); [liquid staked tokens with composability built on top](https://quarkprotocol.com/app/stake?asset=KUJI); [a way to instantly unstake liquid staked tokens and locked liquidity pool positions (which is cheaper than swapping via a DEX)](https://unstake.fi/);  [a DAO enhancing ecosystem liquidity](https://mantadao.app/) & running [a decentralized, automated market maker & aggregation router built on top of FIN](https://mantaswap.app/); [community-owned market making bots](https://hummingbot.org/); [a way to deposit money to passively earn interest for savers](https://www.namifi.app/en); [peer-to-peer off-ramp services](https://app.localmoney.io/); [NFT collections](https://kujira.network/ecosystem), [user-defined raffles](https://plank.fi/), etc.&#x20;
