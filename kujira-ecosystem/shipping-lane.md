# Shipping Lane

### Overview

Every now and then people need a helping hand navigating the treacherous seas of decentralized finance so they can coexist peacefully with the giant whales üêã and other sea life lurking beneath the surface. As we help steer the Kujira community through saccharine and bitter times alike, we guide our constituents through our safe yet performant shipping lane. Detailed below are the past events and landmarks along our long, long shipping lane as we take our stand on shipping, payments, and commerce.

[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16vf3V5pCFrOCeEd5AZrwC5Vi\_SI\_GjAC\_n91Y1LkEQA/edit) is the monthly Kujira Shipping Lane since inception&#x20;

## What's Next?

The Shipping Lane will be updated bi-monthly to allow more resources to be focused on development while preserving the integrity and quality of all underlying documentation. We plan to continue delivering like crazy from here on out. The Kujira Blockchain is just getting started.
