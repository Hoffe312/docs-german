# Kujira News

The Kujira ecosystem is frenetic. Articles, calls, governance proposals, new features, threads, etc. There's action every day and you probably can't track it all.

[Kujira News](https://t.me/KujiNews) aggregates Kujira updates _for you_. It tells you when something happens, with sources, so you don't have to track it yourself, but can verify anything shared.&#x20;

As an **unofficial** _community_ Telegram channel (and [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/KujiNews)) run by [Daniel Lux](../introduction/who-are-team-kujira.md) and [Romano Americano](https://t.me/KujiDAO), we have both the energy and the leeway to share smaller updates that get overlooked elsewhere.

* Catch up on the newest Kujira ecosystem alpha in real time
* Get reminders on: chain upgrades, scheduled [Twitter spaces](https://kujiraspaces.com/), upcoming protocol launches, etc.&#x20;
* Keep track of: announcements, [Kuji Kast](kuji-kast.md) videos, [Senate](../dapps-and-infrastructure/senate.md) meetings, [Weekly Roundups](kujira-socials/medium.md#weekly-roundup), etc.
* Stay up to date on: [content creators](kujira-socials/winkhub.md), developers, governance, protocols, senators, & validators
