# Telegram

Telegram is one of the primary ways to directly communicate with the Kujira team and experienced chat moderators, as well as engage with the community in a more informal setting. It is also a useful platform for receiving updates and announcements from the team. Kujira has three official Telegram chats.

often scammers on Telegram who impersonate team members and moderators in an attempt to hack users through social engineering. Team members and moderators will always have the tags "Team" or "Kujira fren" next to their names when sending messages in chat. If a team member or moderator asks you to private message them, _**it's generally recommended that you message them first after they request it in one of the main chats**_, as imposters may still try to message you privately to deceive you.

### Main Chat

The main Telegram chat focuses on community support, community engagement, fundamental analysis of the Kujira Protocol, and alpha leaks. No price discussion is allowed in the main chat and we strongly encourage it to be kept to an absolute minimum. Memes are of course allowed and encouraged.
